# Mood Tracker

## Our application

Bipolar Disorder is a mixed blessing. It's well known that creativity and Bipolar
disorder are often comorbid, and certainly programmers and engineers will often
know someone who has some form of mood disorder.  

What we're going to create is a mood tracker application, and deploy it on Heroku.

## Our Stories

* As a user, I want to log in securely. No one but myself should have access to my
information.  

* As a user, I want to be able to track my mood swings by day, pointing out highs
and lows for that day.

* As a user, I'd like that data to be remembered and restored for me between login
sessions.

* As a user, I'd like to be able to visualize this data in a chart.

* As a user, I'd like to go back and change previous data (as I may make a mistake);

* As a user, I want to be able to keep a diary as well, where I can write down events
and triggers which resulted in my high and low points.  This should be optional.

* As a user, I'd like to be able to authorize my doctor (and only my doctor)
to see (but not edit) this information.

* As a developer, I want my users to be able to report bugs to me.

* As a developer, I want to be able to replay exactly what they did to create the bug.

* As a developer, I want to make sure that I can replay what they did *without*
replaying what they entered, specifically, to preserve user privacy.

* As a developer, I want to use best practices possible.
