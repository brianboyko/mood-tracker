# Brian Boyko's Boilerplate (BBBoiler)

## (This is a work in progress, please bear with me as I actually build this thing out.)

One of the most powerful tools today for managing state is Redux, and one of the
most powerful frameworks is React.  

However, when users get started with React and Redux, they may get overwhelmed.
Typically boilerplates are designed for users to start working right away on their
apps, but it takes on faith a number of design decisions. In short, it's way
too much, too fast.

All this is is a boilerplate that sets up a basic React/Redux/Babel/Wepback workflow.
